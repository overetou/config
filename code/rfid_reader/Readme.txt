This directory should contain experimental code related to the Stronglink RFID reader SL025B V3.0.
Should another RFID reader be experimented on the repo, I suggest to put this directory into a subdirectory containing the precedent model name.

The communication with the RFID reader is byte oriented so C++ will do perfectly well.
Wiring Pi will be used to catch detection signal and handle UART communication. I will probably upload the reader official documentation on the repo
But you may see it anytime on stronglink official website just by searching the model name.

I will use this directory to transfer code from my laptop to the rasp pi (probably in the two ways), so the source file should stick closely to my true advancement.

Every source file that has been succesfully tested will contain the mention : operational.
