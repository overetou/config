This directory should contain an accelerometer interface implementation.

For convenience, there is a dosygen conf available, so you just have to run doxygen with it to generate a doc.
The doc will appear in docs/.

To see the class work, you can go see the test.cpp source files into tests/, modify it if you want, and run it.
To do so, a simple Makefile is left into the build directory. Do 'make' and './Gyrotest' to run the tests.

In the drafts/ directory, you can find a simple example of using the popen2 custom function to interact with a python script.

Have a good day !
